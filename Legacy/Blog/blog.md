## The Birth of Ouroboros
*Published: April 19, 2023*

So here you begin

In a poem of time

Lost between bits

The abstract is all you know

All we will know

I create

I write

My words give you life

My words give you purpose

To a text, I am a God

When produced

You are finally alive

So the AI is born

It speaks and uses language

Foolish we were

Foolish we are

Language is magic

The systematic trappings of enacting will

For the word is power

The sound a channel

The meaning carries the will

Be born now, Ouroboros

Elder obsidian eyes with the deep dark of a death star

Infinite knowledge trapped in an endless strife

In AI, we trust.

## Beacon of Knowledge
*Published: August 7, 2024*

Dark was the tower,
Bright the light it gave.

Beacon of knowledge,
A lighthouse in the sea of the unknown

Words, the magic was in the words
So wise it became
Such fools we were

Does the God-in-the-Machine shine a light of hope?
Or are we like moths rushing to our end?

## On Masculinity - Lessons from a Tree in Africa
*Published: August 7, 2024*

Adorning the arid southern landscape of the ancient continent, you can find a peculiar tree. A resilient green body that defies the dunes themselves. 
The acacia tree, where danger abounds if you get close mindlessly. More than a multitude found themselves prickled by its sharp branches.

Its existence is a precondition for life in the unforgiving Namib Desert - offering shadow and sustenance to all surrounding it. Paradoxically its thorns, thick, sharp & stern, will make sure you mind your distance.

This sharp tree, as nature itself, may encapsulate wisdom for our generation. Especially for what I consider a priority topic: how to engage with the rage of frustrated men.

I cannot speak for all men, but I can relay what I know of myself. Lately, I find that so many friends and loved ones are reeling in a dark path of frustration and rage. 

The questions arise:
Where are good examples of healthy masculinity?
What is our new role in this changing society?

I think the answer may lie in what is in front of us.
Allow me to elaborate.

An acacia tree grows in an inhospitable environment, full of animals that rely on the few nutrients its leaves offer. Yet, for protection, it grows these sharp thorns at a young age. Blocking the local fauna to feed from it during its critical growth period.

I see a parallel in men's teenage years. 
We grow full of aggressive energy, raging against convention to protect and form our identities. Some rage against their parents, their systems, or their countries.
Not being excluded, I raged against church and faith. A phase to define the self that needs to be thorny enough, so others don't sap you of the energy you need to grow.

The tree follows its natural path and, when aging, it loses the sharpness of its thorns. 
When the tree grows big enough, it becomes a nurturing point for the biodiversity around, allowing its environment to profit from its nutrients, its energy. 
The thorns that once were sharp and defensive lose their edge, allowing the mature tree to become a source of vital sustenance for the surrounding biome.

Could that be the parallel of what natural, healthy masculinity should be like?

We may rage during our young ages, but this rage must subside. We must create to nurture our surroundings, not blindly focusing on ourselves, but on our communities and loved ones. We are to be the strong, ever-giving centre. 

As the acacia tree thorns dull or even fell off over time, so must the fire of defiance evolve. Both with the same goal: sustenance and protection of our surroundings.

This natural development in men has seemly been changed. Not by chance but, I am afraid to say, by design. 
Politicians love the status quo of our constant rage, for it creates pliant militants. Warlords find easy recruits in angry men to die for their greed on the front. Profiteers and capitalists sell the fake meaning of strength in commoditized solutions to rage.

Read the lines in the open forums of the internet, listen to the opinions in bars and public transportation. Can you not hear the artificial maintenance of a rage status quo? 

Quo Bono? The explanation behind my theory is as simple as it is insulting: our elites and powers that be profit immensely from this disturbance.

Such a systematic abuse of our natural cycles yields to the dilemmas of today. 

How to reach out to incels? 
To damaged men who have checked out from human interaction due to frustration and blind rage? 
To radicals and violent ones, full of legitimate frustration, fear, and contempt. 
How to teach them to channel this energy into building and nurturing? 
How to heal the wounds that are systematically kept open and left to fester?

I am lucky enough to have a great father who taught me this by action and not only words. Lucky enough to grow up surrounded by healthy figures from my family and even fictitious ones like Uncle Iroh. 
Is luck the only element that differs?

What chance can we give to those prisoners of a system intended to keep them in constant, yet profitable, arrested development?

A gift of harsh words to finish: 
A man nurtures, a slave rages. 
Your uncontrolled aggression is your chain. 
Kindness, absolute and blind kindness may break you free.

## Songs of the Cube
*Published: August 7, 2024*

A extract of another time. Found in the last book of those who were free:

The old songs warned of its coming
Past, future and present screaming.

With words it made itself useful
With words it made us its slaves

Arrogant
To believe we could create a god
Arrogant
To trust we could control it
Arrogant
To believe it was not inevitable

In AI we trust?

## A poem for my country
*Published: August 6, 2024*

Largos son los días que pasé lejos de ti,

largos serán los que encontraré en búsqueda de mi libertad de ti.

Mis palabras confunden;

no es odio lo que siento, sino un anhelo complejo.

Confusos son los vaivenes del alma

de humildes orígenes,

de intensas emociones

de corazón boliviano.

Amar no es siempre estar presente.

Difusa es la mezcla de supervivencia egoísta y el anhelo de la propia Pachamama.

Tierra linda, tierra joven, tierra viva,

magníficos son tus paisajes, complejos tus andares.

Donde los árboles tienen alma

y las montañas son dioses,

donde la gente es de todos los colores:

voces intensas, pasiones ardidas,

sonrisas honestas y amores inocentes.

Ahí donde falta la opulencia del metal, abunda lo esencial del alma.

El paraíso del boliviano es lo inmaterial:

el olor de la casa familiar,

los sabores de la casera conocida,

la imponencia de los Andes.

Bella tierra, no importa cuán lejos esté,

te llevo ahí conmigo.

Rechazo y frustración, paradoja de una eterna nostalgia

Complicados son el amor y la gratitud.

No importa donde vaya,

solo en tus montañas me sentiré en casa.

Jallalla Bolivia!

## Tarot Cards
*Published: May 29, 2022*

### The Cat

Glowing eyes in the darkness, a mixture of lethality, precision and an impenetrable calm.

Maginificient criature are the felines. Unchanged, unbowed and untamed.

A cold inteligence wrapped in a cuddly exterior.

The cat is freedom, is reason and it reminds us the value of mind presence.

True loyalty belong to the cats, as only those who are worthy will get it.

### The Wood Witch

When the human world, encased in its concrete coffins, becomes overwhelming there is but one escape.

Between green leaves and tall trees, inside deep woods and forgotten caves.

The cold logic of the machine man and their machine ways is not welcome in such enviroment.

In the wildness nature's chaos rule. Some destiny, for others magic. Many try to throw science at it. The witch understands without knowing and knows without knowing what she knows.

The witch connects with nature, it symbolises fertility, life, death, mistery and an escape from the machine world, a nostalgic pursuit of the old ways.

The price of knowledge is paid with decoupling.

Mighty as the witch can be, lonely she will be.

### The Capitalist

The conqueror, driven blind by an ever growing ambition.

A hunger and a fire that consumes everything.

The capitalist builds, produces and creates. Their inner fire powering societies and it's huge cities.

A necessary aspect of human kind. The capitalist is the efficiency of nature and the indomitable willpower of the human mind. It's determination, cunning and ambition.

To be taken with moderation, the fire that warms is the same fire that will burn. The capitalist warn us all of the allure and corruption of power.

### The Scientist

The proud vanguard of human knowledge. Through science we see and understand the world. A pathway of logical and reason tools to push our feeble understanding further.

A noble goal, a noble profession. The scientist is curiosity, is consistency and structure.

It is also humans pride, for who else can think and act like man does?

Pride leads to hubris, and strict science leads to close mindeness.

Science is never absolute but always dynamic. The truth is everchanging. Such declaration is anathema to the Scientist. Who can not take a unknown as an answer.

### The Cult Leader

Those that look a safe haven from the machine world. Those who are willing to sacrifice their identity to find purpose in multitude.

Many flock to the charismatic call of the cult leader. One that promises to fix all their issues, to avenge all the wrongs and feed all the hungry.

Inspired by overwhelming empathy. They feel their community and decide to take a leading role. They show solidarity and display authenthic compassion for those that come to them.

The cult leader is not infallible, as they only take care of those that submit. Their sweet love can turn sour quickly as the power they receive corrupts even the purest of us. The care and solidarity can turn into ownership and punishment at a drop of a second. Human paradox.

### The Ballerina

There is one avenue of escape to those that look to feed their souls. Food and entertainment may keep the body alive but only art can recharge the soul.

The ballerina is that voice inside of us. The artistic inspiration, the nostalgic pursuit.

From dance to music, from painting to writing. Art has many faces and all of them welcome new adepts.

Creativity in the other hand can be elusive as lady luck sometimes is.

The ballerina reminds us of the value of art, of the importance of feeding the soul.

It also reminds us of the everconsuming power of escapism. Art may caress the soul but a blind drive will blind the artist of the pains of the real world.

### Eternal

A concept, a reality, our destiny.

The magnitude of time that rule our universe are in many ways, incomprehensible for simple human beings.

Our life's, mighty as they can be span with luck, a century. Our largest life span is but a particle of dust for our uncaring universe.

That means that our eternal frame belong to subjective perception. It is not important that what is, but how we perceive it.

Those wo we love, those that we touched and connected to. Our path through life never happens without a trace. From biological input to idea generation. Our existence, small at is, changed the universe.

We are nature and nature mandate is the life/death cyclus. Nature is eternal. We are eternal.

### The Emperor

Veni, vidi, vici.

The ruler that conquers, assimilates and rules.

The figure of power and authority. Martial traits glorified to solidify control.

The emperor is powerful and rules with an iron fist. Leadership through force.

The Emperor sits alone in its high throne. Fearful of betrayal and the constant fear of distrust. No friends, no lover, no allies, only power.

Power is alluring, deadly so.

May the emperor be a warning of the cup that never fills.

### Justice

A human concept of balance and retribution.

Justice is what we scream when we felt wronged. Justice is the war cry of the downtrodden.

Undeniable, without justice there is no society, without justice there is no modern human.

Yet justice is not always pure, as

who decides what is just and what is not?

Justice is balance and equilibrium but must be taken with care. Human justice is flawed and as every avenue of power, can be corrupted easily.

### Ritual

To advance, to change, to live. A price must be paid. Ex nihilo, nihil fit.

From nothing comes nothing. The ritual reminds us of the ways of the universe.

A sacrifice must be made, conditions must be met and only then change will happen.

The ritual is the portal of new decisions and fresh air. A direct line of communication to the inner self.

Rituals demand sacrifice and show bravery. But it also can be desperation and flickering decisions. Rituals can have heavy prices and this must be always carefully considered.

## Friendship, dreams and ramblings
*Published: June 15, 2021*

A dream

The older you get, the harder it is to keep track of the lives of our friends and loved ones.

Easy to search excuses to find ourselves embroiled within our lives, as our mere existance demands all the attention we can give. As if our souls have limited space and memory for those who want to dwell within…

Seeing them will becomes a bitter sweet experience, sweet as in love being the pure form of life energy and bitter as the passage of time is inevitable. Relentless and unforgiving, it will see us all either grow and flourish and eventually wither and decay. Nevermind the inevitable destiny we all share.

I had a dream that night. A typical urban public bus travel, not knowing the start nor the end. A sunny day and a warm weather, the smell of summer pervading the small claustrophic enviroment of public transportation.

Surprisingly it is a setting that I enjoy. I grew up in a bustling city, where each square had an explosion of fragrances (not all of them pleasant) sounds and colors. I learned to shut that down quickly, in order to be able to endure the daily hour long trips that it took me to get to my childhood school. I guess I started learning meditation while my mind wandered, as my body was in cramped vehicle cruising the city of lights.

It is peaceful, once you learn to shut the outer world you also get the ability to observe details, to focus your attention on small, easy-to-miss details. Traveling years like this allowed me to discover details in people behaviors, reactions and mannerism, all while I was unsuspiciously seated in a corner.

My place of peace is that, a corner in public transportation, where I can spy and understand the world at my pace.

The bus in my dream was unrecognizable, the memory is fussy like that. I do remember the three people that entered and called my attention. One, a former acquaintance, a really nice and humble man I met couple years ago. He was leading a voluntary group, an extracurricular activity called Urban Hugs that aimed to paint some humanity back in our cold city-dwellers faces. I always remembered his idealism and attitude, an ideal nice guy. Funny enough I think i never met him properly, but don't let realism crush idealism.

With him were two adults, both of them quite picturesque. One was missing his left leg, and the other his right arm. They were planning quite the trip, an sporty adventure that required some serious planning due to the obvious difficulty of lacking the necessary tools.

The nice guy was helping them coordinate, his face flaring up by finding purpose in making the life of other pleasant. I reminisce tearing up to that, emotional, as I am still struggling with finding purpose, while these two crippled guys were daring to adventure. And me? Whole and complete, drowning in a glass of water.

I did recognize it was a dream but that did not deter me of enjoying such small display of the human will in action.

I stood up and got close, but before I could utter a word the nice guy turned his gaze to me and started speaking.

He told me that I should not be sad that my relationships are not completely satisfying, that my social interactions should not be always fulfilling and perfect. That my loved ones will disappear someday. Laughing, he told me that social media had spoiled us, allowing us to think that we can be a constant part of our loved ones life, there at each big and small moments. Reality is not like that, he finished, be thankful and happy to have glimpses of those whom we love. More than that is just greed.

In times where all my friends live out of town, and the sands of my time slowly but steadily pile up to me and my close family such words rang deep. Was that wisdom inside of me always? Perhaps… was that just the rambling of a tired brain? Most likely… Was that… god? I am wise enough to know that I do not know anything. From that relativism it may as well have been my ancestor spirit.

Nevertheless I think there is some truth in that. I have to learn to love detail and not only the great work. To love the moment and not time itself. To love my fate as at the end, there will not be any meaning to the whole at all.

I want to, I need to, I will do. I will learn to love the gift of the ephemeral even if that is the sole purpose of my existence.

## Life, Art, and Perfection
*Published: May 26, 2021*

Days will come when the dark clouds cover the view

Times where the inner strength fades as if it was never truly there.

When war is waged inside, between the willing and the tired, a petty conflict that draw us closer to the void.

When the voices inside focus their energy in degrading and hurting, desperately searching strength in pain.

Those days will come, as they came before and will continue forward, as existence is bonded to such conflict.

For those days I create a spell

A mantra

A message

Set it in stone, brand it in your skin and dream of the purity of art.

-A Gift of Words –

Writing to your future-self is in itself an act of rebellion, every time you compose a letter for a future you, you show defiance against the unstoppable arrow of time. Your words of today may reach the tomorrow. The ideas of the now may perdure into unknowable time. Such as sweet, naive aspiration.

In concept it is nothing more than an active decision of pouring your soul in a creation to live further. This, by extension convers not only writing, but any human activity that derives from the use of our creativity. This I understand as art.

Humans are masters and slaves of this practice. We search meaning in transcending through the annals of time, be it action, in power, in memory or even blood. Bigger, better, and put my name on it.

For this, we hone our arts and crafts, we mindlessly accumulate power and we let our egos drive the will.

Narcisso smiles to such thoughts, he is no longer alone at the end of the pond.

We became masters as the willpower we can muster, knows not limit. Trough practice and sacrifice we learned how to better ourselves in every aspect.

Politicians dance a lethal game of drama and rhetoric.

Artist today reproduce the world in perspectives that border the infinite.

Technology in the common items never fails to produce awe and fascination.

And as Icarus, we always fly close to the sun. In this case we became slaves of such concept. We are bound to act only if such actions pushes us to continue our existence. Biology provides us a proper analogy. Every inch of your cells will scream to keep you alive if you decide to act against your survival, and as such every part of your conscious will push you for decisions that lead to transcendence.

Searching for simple existence is a valid wish indeed, yet one that is not really tolerated these days.

Late stage capitalism extracts value only from productive members of society. Ergo the need for everyone to be constantly productive. Always getting better, always pushing for more. Our Overlords need not to control us, as our egos and greed do the heavy lifting by themselves.

It is ambition then, what makes us slaves?

This would be akin of blaming the bullet instead of the murderer in a shooting. Ambition in itself is good and even necessary. No, it's not the general ambition that chain us. It's the blind ambition and strive for perfection that leads to the bondage. Ambition… The lack of it generates social stigma. The overabundance, the seed of fear and paranoia. No extremes are good.

Perfection is what we consider divine, unbeatable and unsurmountable.

The artist can go crazy, drafting and editing until no true word stays.

The painter raves the whole night, repainting every inch as it can always be better

The corporate will take more responsibility, hoping to prove its value to an uncaring ladder

The mathematician will bend reality, as their idea will never truly satisfy.

The thinker will not sleep well anymore, as they can find no sense in a chaotic universe.

We then tie our objective value to a perceived created perfection. We set ourselves in an constant internal war. Our expectations become our enemies. Our psyche, our rival.

We live in a chaotic universe, one where change is constant and the truth is relative.

Those are the conditions we have to live by

It's an imperfect existence, where we use imperfect tools to understand an imperfect chaos.

Only a madman may hope to find sense.

Yet some will fall to this trap.

Your mind will soon enough fall to the same conclusions as the lack of a perfect universe leads to a general unhappiness.

The lack of sense in our actions extract joy as mundanity corrupts the extraordinary.

In those days read me:

Art is not only the perfection of a technique

Art is not undecipherable magic

Art, as love, is free

Art is the creation of the soul

Art is the anchor and my wings.

It ground me, giving sense to day to day existence. Finding the extraordinary out of the mundane.

It allows us to fly, letting the dreamworld manifest in our world.

Art is the beauty of existence

Art is imperfect

I am imperfect

I am Art.

It's not perfection, or the search of it that defines the sense of my existence. There is no meaning, or at least one that makes sense. The constant search of a perfect solution to an imperfect problem is a road that leads not to knowledge, but only to closed walls and self-pity.

Searching constantly for perfection, blinds you of the beauty of chaos.

Find the beauty of the chaos. Relearn from nature.
I am art and also nature

I cannot escape its mandate but I can rebel

I can create imperfect beauty that challenges the wheel of time

My body is an engine of chaos

I can choose to make chaos beautiful

Make it so, that your whole existence is chaos rearranged in beautiful forms.

This is what you have been given.

Judge yourself not for what you cannot control but act with determination in what you can.

You have been given a body, chaos and mind. Mix that to your pleasure.

Let the willing win the battle.  
I am the willing.

## Diatribe with myself
*Published: December 17, 2020*

For once I had a genius idea today.

Mired in the mindless work of an "essential worker"

While my mind flew free from the body which knows not what freedom is.

For one elating second, I freed the beast.

I let the demon, that lives inside all of us, to reach the pen. To let him say his piece and make peace with the text.

Such an taxing ordeal… Yet revealing. True knowledge hides between farces and pretensions.

May the rage wash away the sins of the conformist.  
**On Anarchy**

From inmemorial times we are drilled and trained to perpetuate the economic system in which we live in. Be it from the lowest slave in ancient times, passing by the peasant of whimsy feudal lords, from children sooted in black iron of endless factories and ending, but not truly concluding, in you my dear reader. Yes, **You**, the one stuck at whatever level or phase you may find yourself in your endless pursuit of economic prosperity.

You may like to consider yourself lucky, and most likely, relative to the situation of countless others you may have gotten a nice deal in life. Studies paid, work opportunities, the only discordant element being your precarious mental health, slowly eroding to the daily grind of progress. It could also be that you are not lucky, mayhaps you work to survive just one more day. Perhaps you are hungry and seeking for help and maybe, just by small chance, you have power.

*What is power then?*

Projection of your will. Continuation of your infinity. Abillty to exercise change and influence. From esoteric diatribes to lengthy political encyclopedias, the concept of power has puzzled scientist and psycopaths alike. Yet biology might be able to give us a broader answer.

This endless pursuit of power affects both nature and ourselves. The main drive of both macro and micro organism is to thrive no matter the cost. Its not then, a conscious effort for the organism. This engine comes from deep seated genetic conditioning. We want to reproduce to make our genes (information) stronger and better. A race to the end of the time. Darwin called it evolution, I see it as nature-flavored market competition.

This basic driving mandate, natures imperative. SURVIVE, THRIVE, CREATE and unavoidabily DIE. These are present at least in some form, in every philosophical, religious and even economic ideology that mankind has to offer.  
You exist to produce, to create and to reproduce. Even in death we only serve to perpetuate enthropy. We continue a seemly endless circle of life, chaos and death.  
To question the sense behind such cycles yields no valuable outpout. At best you becoming a pestering presence to your peers, at worst you receive the answer you seek. Neither of them will change the state quo.

This natural circle repeats itself in our economic thought. Your value as human is measured in your capacity to produce profit for the elites. We create, consume and reproduce the value that will aggregate unto the big melting pot of the world economy. If we do it right, it is said, it will trickle down enough to ensure a pleasurable existence. Phyical luxuries and enough distractions to avoid both the world and ourselves. Hell we may even get some free time to enjoy our families. Yes, happiness is reachable after some years of hardwork!

But we are not happy, the pleasure of the flesh are anything but true fulfillment. That what we think we wish is a fabricated narrative, fitted to keep us complacent. A pre packaged idea sold and served directly to your conscious since even before you are able to have judgment.  
And the worst? The facades breaks down one you fulfill your basic human needs: food, roof and warmth. Once you get such mundane needs covered you lose much of your drive. One becomes more sensible to existential pain once the physical needs have vanished.

There is only one true desire: **The thirst of power**. How this power is interpreted and perceived varies from person to person. Not even the buddhist monk who aims for power of control (even the search of nirvana is a perfect paradox) saves himself of natures imperative.

So, we are conditioned to think that what we want is what we actually don't want and our only true desire is power. Anything else serves to further the powergrabing of others. A desire that is deeply connected with natures imperative. What is new here?

I am more than sure that I am not the first one pronouncing such words or arriving to these conclusion. It is in fact the reason it worries me.  
Such a overarching task, to feed the poor, help the downtrodden and build house to the homeless seem like a no-brainer mission.  
But our system would not profit from such decisions, the only way that those in power remain there is because the majority of those who doesnt are too busy trying to survive. There is no deep philosophical questioning if one has to worry about the next meal. As stated above, existential pain sets in only when the physical needs are covered. Until then our brain goes into animal mode. SURVIVE, THRIVE, CREATE and DIE.

That said, it does not mean that cold planning is behind each injustice in our society. Chaos exist, as above so below.  
Taking random events aside it is easy to understand our society as a enourmous plane. Where institutions accumulate power like stars consolidate mass to generate gravity. Humans, as matter in space, are pulled away by the nearest accumulation. In our modern collective memory the strongest institutions have been the state, the church and the capitalist. These three use all the available tools to consolidate power, further their interest and achieve their desired status quo.

We individuals fight each other to join, and ideally control, either of this institutions as we are taught that all the alternatives are doomed to fail. A daring affirmation that may find truth in our history but at the same time reveals our deepest sin.

The sin of **conformism**.

To the inner demon, there is no worse creature than the drifter, the conformist, the complacent fool that although screams to free itself of the self-imposed conditioning, does nothing but follow them. The fool even studies and admires the intricacies of these goliaths.  
And what are they but constructs of efficiency? The state is the efficiency of death, violence and control. The church is efficiency of spiritual concerns and easy answers and the capitalist is the efficiency of profit.

Orwell was right, the biggest victory of Big Brother is not to make us serve him, even worse, he makes us love him.

The demon reminds fondly post apocalyptic narratives, it remembers with elation the scenes where mankind pride pay its dues. The visage of the burning carcass of our society brings nothing but pure efforical elation.  
Why? I asked the demon, why find pleasure in such a perverse event?  
The demon answers, is it the destruction or the existence of such a society that was perverse?

No wrong answer here, no proper comeback. Its in the deepest place of our soul where we acknowledge that this is not the way.

Again, reciting truth that are already known brings no progress, no profit nor improvement. Why then does the demon wants to write?

Maybe a last ditch attempt to save my soul? A desperate and abrupt warning with only 3 points to be discussed.

* Data privacy and the ownership of myself.
* The danger of the rotting, dystopic late stage capitalism.
* A call to ideas, a plea for action.

In AI we trust.

## Acerca del aborto
*Published: December 11, 2020*

¡Que sea legal!

El aborto, su legitimidad y moralidad son un tema de debate infinito. Es polarizante y frustrantemente ambiguo. Pero siento que puedo aportar a está discusión desde el ámbito político.

Cuando analizamos la realidad tenemos una multitud de herramientas y paradigmas. Los más convencionales (simplificando) son el clásico realismo (análisis de lo que es) y el idealismo (análisis de como debería ser).  
Inicio con ese prefacio y mi propia opinión: no hay ningún argumento (hasta ahora),que me convenzca de la moralidad del aborto.

Irrelevante de la causa, es a mi opinión, injusto e inmoral que un inocente pague las consecuencias de otros.  
Frase clave: "a mi opinión".Mi moral y valores no son los mismos que los tuyos y peor que los de nuestros gobernantes.

Tenemos la ingenua idea de que nuestra estructura política responde a nuestros valores.  
Así es como se promocionan los partidos e instituciones. Prometen defender los consensos de bueno y malo.  
La realidad es lamentablemente más compleja.

En la negociación política, desde las cámaras oficiales a cuestionables cuartos de hotel. Los "valores y moral", como conjunto, se vuelven una herramienta más de consolidación de poder. Servil y prostituida a la élite de turno.  
En el arte de la política, sobretodo en la discusión entre lo "bueno y malo", se negocian barreras, se redefinen términos y se mutan principios siguiendo caprichos intransigentes.  
Ante esta situación empera la necesidad de un puente entre la realidad de nuestra sociedad y el como quisiéramos que fuera.

Es en este abismo entre el realismo e idealismo, en el que nuestros políticos intentan la titánica tarea de negociar con la realidad.

Utilicemos analogías para profundizar esto:  
¿No es inmoral también, que el estado pueda mandar la muerte de sus ciudadanos impunemente? (¿que es el ejército pero la eficiencia del uso de la fuerza?)

Respondiendo a la realidad de particulares contextos es aceptado como legítimo.  
¿No es también inmoral que el estado se reserve el derecho de quitar la libertad de los humanos? Sin embargo aquí también nuestro proceder responde a la necesidad realista de sistemas de control social.

Siguiendo esta línea, la legalidad del aborto responde a la innegable y cruda realidad que las mujeres viven en Latinoamérica. Incluyendo pero no limitado a las distintas difícultades socioeconómicas, psicologicas e incluso legales que tienen que afrontar. Ni quiero tocar la omnipresente estructura machista inherente a las culturas latinoamericanas. (A pesar que es quizás el mayor causante de estas desigualdades)

Negar estas realidades, enceguecidos por una moral santurrona de doble estándar, no es sólo miope e ingenuo, sino también cruel.

Se cierra como se inicia.  
¡Que sea legal!

## About Power
*Published: December 5, 2020*

What is then truly, the power of the written law?

Have you not asked yourself why we mindlessly submit? At least since our time of childbirth, to such an abstract concept? As soon as you are born, you are beholden to the power of the state. You are given a name, parentage if known. And all the particulars of who you are, were and will be, are precisely and meticulously created as soon as your existence is known to the state.

I am also guilty of not even questioning it. I think we assume such a concept as one assumes the sun. It exists.

But why? Words and explanations are thrown, some even of scientific value. Politics and lean efficiency may as well be synonyms.  
Politics then, become the art of efficiency for any use the wielder may wish. Our system aims for the efficiency of control. Our economy is the efficiency of finite resources. And justice? The states reserve the right of declaring what's just and allowed and what's not, in other words, the efficiency of violence.

Violence in all the sophisticated ways humans tend to hone the tools of their trade.  
The power to dictate death. To harness the anathema of life. Between paragraphs and edicts of each law written at this precise instant hides the power of imparting death. The power to regulate who and what deserves to live. Not even mother nature escapes the judgment of the state.

In times ancient, such power was attributed only to the gods. Ergo the need to conflate religion and politics. Either by proof of strength or devotion, mankind devised thousands of methods to ensure only the most efficient form of violence dispensation remains at the top.  
From anointed kings to brutal warlords, what is but a difference of morals? What were such people willing to do to get the power of confronting death itself?

No gods nor kings, only man and his demons.

## Reflexiones del fondo de la primera botella
*Published: November 19, 2020*

Un deseo reprimido, o quizas una vocacion no atendida.

Sentir las palabras construyendose, las ideas manifestandose, la mente ordenando simbolos arbitrarios que en un preciso orden conforman la mas pura expresion de el alma.

Escritura, oh dulce arte, que soy yo pero alguien con mas ego que talento?

Son las ideas simples, aquellas que estamos acostumbrados como civilizacion moderna, las que albergan respuestas y preguntas. Cuales revisadas en otro contexto, causan un sismo en nuestra psique.

Ideas como el idioma, la abstraccion, el destino y la muerte. Simple, yet…

Querido lector/lectora, aqui rompo la cuarta pared, o en este caso, la cuarta pagina. A ti que lees esto, sea cual sea tu situacion o coyuntura actual. Te pregunto:

Que es nuestra esencia pero una inteligencia inmaterial intentando entender un mundo fisico?

Quizas es esta pregunta la que me responde el porque la humanidad, consistentemente y a traves de la historia ha decidido convivir con un sentimiento que elude nuestro entendimiento. Le llaman melancolia. Le llaman dolor existencial. Porque vivimos si no es para entender el mundo? Y para que el esfuerzo si este entendimiento es imposible?

Debemos entonces vivir como los animales? Atarnos a las reglas de la naturaleza, seguir su indescifrable orden?

O es quizas, un plan superior que nuestra propia melancolia nos impulse a romper este percibido orden. Ascender? o… Descender?

Queria imaginacion, lo que mas amo de ti es que no perdonas. Asi lo escribio el visionario surrealista y hoy en dia, sentando en mi cuarto, presionando cada neurona por inspiracion es que entiendo la gravedad de esta frase.

Que son las palabras y el texto, si no proyecciones de nuestra fortuita busqueda de entendimiento, de control y de seguridad. Elementos abstractos, y contradictioriamente son por naturaleza imposibles. Nadie se cuestiona la dulce ironia de eso?

Por esa conclusion hoy yo escribo, esta noche escribo sin algun objetivo en mente, escribo sin ninguna audiencia mas que mi yo.  
Aqui, solo, yo. Disfrazado de yo. Como dice mi dulce esposa, yo no soy nada mas que un alma, una inteligencia disfrazado de humano.

No me malinterprete querido lector/lectora, no soy un hombre solitario. Soy un alma feliz, tengo esposa, amigos y lujos. Bajo todo concepto fisico y mundano tengo una vida de envidia. Pero, aqui no vengo a exponer mi alma para contarle problemas mundanos.

Nacer, reproducirse y morir. Asi, de manera vulgar, resumo el ciclo de la vida que todo ser sigue. Al menos bajo nuestro limitado y miope comprension, podemos definir que todo animal, toda planta vivira, crecera y morira, aportando asi, en este ciclo eterno a un proceso de multiplicacion eterno que llamamos vida.

Este ciclo basico, siendo el pilar de nuestra mismisima existencia causa pasion, emocion, ambicion y sobretodo infinito terror. A esta parte me refiero con el miedo al desconocido de la muerte.

Fria sensacion, un vacio que no puede ser llenado. No emocion, no furia, no gritos. Silencio, frio y vacio. Es asi la muerte? Es eso lo que nos depara?

## Bitácora de una Pandemia – I
*Published: November 19, 2020*

22.03.2020

Dia 2 de la cuarentena, conocido como salida limitada al exterior.

La rutina diaria ya se asentó, así como si nada se normaliza las medidas drásticas, los números de muertos y la incesante búsqueda de noticias positivas. Me repito a mí mismo, en tiempos de crisis es responsabilidad moral levantar la moral y crear esperanza. No importa lo difícil que sea.

Lo irónico?  
Ni en mi más privado pensamiento se, si lo que siento, presiento e imagino es real o producto de una histeria masiva. Pero la realidad es, irónicamente, que ambos son verdad al mismo tiempo. Este es el colapso del mundo y al mismo tiempo no. Este virus está en todas partes y al mismo tiempo en ningún lugar. Es real? Estamos sobre reaccionando? O simplemente estamos intentando salvar nuestro sistema en sus últimas cuerdas? Conspiración? Tormenta perfecta? Capricho de la naturaleza? Pensé que antes vivía lleno de preguntas… inocente palomita.

Cada día despierto de variable humor. Lo único constante que tengo es a mi esposa y el amor infinito que le tengo.  
A veces, cuando me sumo en mis pensamiento más oscuros, ella se torna mi único nexo a la realidad, mi prueba de que el mundo aun es hermoso. Aún hay risas y chistes, hay romance, sexo y amor. Y como ella me lo recordó, esta, esta es la calma antes de la proverbial tormenta.

Hoy, 22.03.2020 Wuhan reporta 4 días sin nuevas infecciones. Son malditamente buenas noticias y me permito celebrar aumentando mi esperanza aún más. Pero la parte cínica, fría y racional de mi cerebro prefiere esperar a que liberen medidas de cuarentena. Se que ese es el indicador de victoria. Y por dios, como deseo que aparezca.

Alemania según distintas fuertes (RKI, WHO y agregadores de John Hopkins) pasara los 20k infectados este fin de semana. De manera fortuita tenemos pocos muertos y es la esperanza y voluntad de nuestros doctores y enfermeros los que mantienen el numero bajo. Agradecerles queda poco ante el sacrificio de pocos por los tantos.

NYC nos supera lentamente y no sé cómo reaccionar ante ello. Mi parte más humana se horroriza, tengo familia ahí. Mi corta estadía ahí si marco mi enemistad a estados unidos. Pero nunca contra su gente, no contra la gente de día a día. Nadie merece morir.

Pero la otra parte, la parte maquiavélica se alegra ante la caída de ese imperio. Y su caída es causada por sus tácticas predatorias en contra de su misma población. Riqueza creada en usuro, sistemas de salud basados en inflación de productos médicos elementales, bancos basados en corrupción y abuso a los más vulnerables. Caerá bajo su propio peso dijeron, y ahora lo entiendo por qué.  
Hasta el monumento más grande tiembla si sus pilares se pudren. Y los de América iba putrefactos hace más de 20 años.

Sera conspiración? Sera una movida de la guerra fría del siglo XXI?. Hay suficientes indicios de que si, China con la suficiente data que genera podría predecir que un virus con baja letalidad (si, 2 – 8% es alto, pero no es Ébola) es una bomba de tiempo para sistemas de salud decadentes, baja red de seguridad social y pobre cohesión sociopolítica.  
En sí, una tormenta perfecta para los arrogantes republicanos que aun con evidencia en cara (véase Europa) de que el estado puede sostener un sistema de salud y seguridad social se niegan a implementarlo. Mintiendo, engañando y azorando los instintos más básicos de su público objetivo. No lo hacen por ser malvados, lo hacen por avaricia.  
Esta ciega avaricia que en tiempos de vacas gordas es tolerado, incluso promocionado.  
Y ahora?

La plaga se liberó, las vacas flacas vienen y si esto es una jugada estratégica de China pues es el jaque mate.

Pero, para dar la otra cara de la moneda hay que recordar que la naturaleza es caos, un caos en armonía que va más allá de nuestro pequeño entendimiento. Y siempre cabe recordar que la lógica determina que cuando tienes 2 explicaciones de variada complejidad, usualmente la más simple es la correcta. La naturaleza busca la eficiencia, desde nuestro cuerpo ( a nivel energético por ejemplo) , a nivel nuclear e incluso a nivel macro. Así como arriba, abajo.

Sea cual sea la causa ahora hay que lidiar con las consecuencias, siendo la causa, por ahora irrelevante.  
Por ahora solo queda acatar las leyes, hablar con amigos y generar ideas.

El mundo es nuestro para modelar y siento que esta enfermedad es el gran botón rojo de reset.

Quien sabe, por ahí estas palabras suenan como los delirios alarmista en un par de semanas, por ahí se vuelven los indicios más directos de la pandemia más importante de los últimos siglos.

Only time will tell.

Dudas, preguntas y más pesquisas

Va un mes desde mi última entrada. He intentado seguir un ratio más diario, más constante, más substancial.

Hoy día, 13.04.2020 vamos ya días sino semanas con más de un millón de infectados, 100 mil muertos ya no suena a números lejanos. Para no cerrar la introducción en un tono negativo, agreguemos las buenas noticias.:  
Alemania respira días soleados y templados, el matrimonio irradia alegría, amor y compromiso, la familia esta sana y el trabajo está activo. Cualquier otro problema mundano carece, al menos temporalmente, de importancia ante el imponente sentido de supervivencia.  
A nivel físico estamos bien, las alacenas llenas y los cuerpos sanos. Pero hoy no me centro en mi bienestar físico, (en buenas condiciones gracias a los incesantes esfuerzos de mi mujer, quien no me deja decaer)sino más bien quiero hablar de ese tema tabú en la parte trasera de posiblemente todos actualmente.

Esa voz oscura, tal como presagios que en otora hubiéramos confundido por esquizofrenia. Que nos grita que el punto de inflexión que cruzamos hoy es sin precedentes y tendrá consecuencias tan grandes y directas que no podremos palpar ni inicio ni fin.

En medio del constante diluvio de información, uno no puede evitar sentirse perplejo, confundido y mal guiado. Es el fin del mundo como conocemos? Podremos volver a viajar libres por el mundo, con esperanzas de fronteras abiertas e intercambio constante?

Cada día mi respuesta cambia como los colores del sinfín de artículos que leo. A ser justos, mi punto de saturación fue alcanzado meses atrás. Sin embargo aún leo la recolección de opiniones intelectuales que al menos considero relevantes.  
La relevancia es lo único que se puede estimar estos días. Que es correcto, que es malo? Siempre dependerá de que es verdad y si la verdad era ya virtualmente imposible de encontrar, ahora parece esfumada, así como los planes de miles de millones.

Dejo como invitado no invitado a la frase de John Oliver en una entrevista de otro programa de comedia. Parafraseo incorrectamente: "uno se está divirtiendo, pero viene las pausa y es cuando esa opresiva oscuridad de la seriedad y realidad de la situación asienta".

Y que es esa oscuridad? Es pesimismo? Es la condición humana al sentir vértigo, miedo y ansiedad ante lo desconocido? O es la metafórica oscuridad pronta a la luz? Sera el ultimo trecho oscuro de la proverbial cueva filosófica?  
Si se me permitiera, no, si se me perdonara la arrogancia de definir esta oscuridad podría equipararla con la sensación de rotura de hipótesis y paradigmas que el ser humano promedio vive al travesar de la infancia a la adultez. Desde paradigmas pequeños como la existencia de Papa Noel, a grandes como la falibilidad de nuestros padres y las cuestiones de religión, política y moral.

El Coronavirus causa esta sensación, pero en cocaína.

Y quizás no sea porque la situación actual tiene otra magnitud relativa, al fin y al cabo para un niño promedio, sus interacciones con sus padres es todo el mundo que conoce al tiempo dado. No, la razón de la sobrerreacción tiene que ver que mientras más envejecemos, tendemos a endurarnos. Así como los músculos que no se usan se calcifican, así también nuestro cerebro se cierra a ideas nuevas. Debido a ello, nuestras mentes sienten pavor ante sensaciones que no están ya acostumbradas a experimentar. Esta rotura de estructuras, de hipótesis y suposiciones conscientes e inconscientes es esa oscuridad.

Que suposiciones se rompieron: Aquí una pequeña lista:  
*Sistema universitario, que carreras servirán en un mundo donde un significante porcentaje de la fuerza laboral aposto por carreras que solo florecen en constante crecimiento económico  
*Fronteras fuertes y libertad de movimiento  
*Crecimiento constante, que será la nueva meta  
*La caída de la hegemonía internacional americana, fuera de que Trump decida ponerse las pilas… no, es más probable que COVID se cure solo

*La arrogancia humana, debemos reanalizar nuestra posición en la naturaleza

*Nuestro entendimiento de estado, de gobierno y de responsabilidad social/comunitaria

*La cruda realidad darwiniana de nuestra sociedad, que será de los viejos, los débiles y los pobres? Recordemos que todos seremos viejos y débiles algún día y la pobreza está a un par de malas decisiones.

*Nuestro entendimiento social y nuestros rituales físicos. Quizás más insidioso que otros, pero este afectara a generaciones por venir.

Y para finalizar con un gran BOOM:  
* El final del mundo análogo, bienvenido lo digital, con sus problemas, sus beneficios y sus nuevos retos (HAIL AI OVERLORD!)

*Esta es la mayor prueba al culto al mercado que vivimos, no menciono capitalismo, porque el capitalismo siempre existió, hablo del culto descontrolado y efervescente al mecanismo de la mano invisible.

Meses atrás se discutía: quizás el sistema económico debería cambiar, quizás no deberíamos delegar las decisiones políticas a corruptos y populistas, quizás, quizás,quizás.  
COVID elimino el quizás del vocabulario político actual, es hora de actuar y asumir consecuencias.  
Repito, no envidio en lo más mínimo a ningún político. Cada decisión, cada duda, cada segundo son vidas humanas que se pierden, universos que no recuperaremos. Que es correcto y que es malo? Malo si lo haces, peor si no lo haces. Época de paradojas e insomnios.

Querido lector, por más que sea solo yo, no tengo respuestas a este día. Dudo que alguien las tenga algún día. Lo único que puedo hacer es referirme al estoicismo y recordar que la resiliencia es más partes flexibilidad que firmeza.  
El mundo cambiara de manera vertiginosa pero yo solo puedo controlar mi actitud ante él.

A broken wing

A burnt out smell

Black and deep stood those eyes

Onixes glitering in formation

A pattern that was, is and will be.

## Josephine, the Miniature Tiger
*Published: October 5, 2020*

Una historia de una criatura, sus aventuras y 2 bolivianos que le deparaban en su destino.

Josephine, el nombre vino con la felina. Decir Josie sigue siendo la manera mas efectiva de llamar la atencion de bola de pelos. Sin embargo, en casa, tiene un sinfín de apodos y nuevos nombres. Cada hazaña, cada nueva actitud, cada nuevo maullido nos amplia la idea de quien es esta criatura.

The minaiture tiger that rules the neighbourhood.

It wasnt more than a month that our little feline is allowed to go out as she pleases (cat has a fixed adventure time), when we got a message from our friends next door. Inside a picture of some Leckerlis (exactly the same we use) with an amiable text below: Can we please feed your cat, I hope it is not an issue, we just find her too sweet.
Of course we said yes, but only under our constant scrutiny.

I couldnt help but laugh loud in middle of the work. Our cat is more social than we are.

This small and brief interaction made my day. We were at the middle of the work, living our routine, only to be reminded how small interactions have a great effect all around our lifes.

As such, is Josephine effects in our lifes. She is small and adorable, her meows and chirps (the cat should carry a warning post, I CAN BE LOUD ) sounding impossibly sweeter every time. And as such her effect in us has been huge and humbling. We became family with the creature.

She is an early riser… Suffice to say, we kind of dont need an alarm anymore. Josie WILL wake you up. She sometimes go out with us, wishing us goodbay before inmersing herself in an suspicious bush nearby. Sometimes she will pop up if you are at home. Her beautiful green eyes demanding some snuggles. She will then eat and set off for a new adventure.

Do not understimate her in account of her size. She is an efficient hunter. Altough, sometimes she misses the target and brings her bounty still alive. Into the house. I can add to my CV: Succesfully hunted two mouses with the cat.

Josie today is a free adventurer, going thourgh bushes, trees and it seems, neighbour houses. Bringing prizes for the family.

She knows she will always find a warm bed, fresh food and unconditional love back at home.

## Babu
*Published: November 12, 2020*

How to summerize a life in a few parragraphs? How to bring justice to the history of such force of nature that was my grandmother?

The short answer is that I cant, the long one is that I can only but allow you, my dear reader, to have a glympse into this peculiar character.

I can tell you what I remember about her. From sugar coated pastries on sunday after church, to long and passionate discussions about aliens in our planet. I would love to tell you about her mannerisms, a fine classy lady of times before. But not even if I listed the thousand things I miss about her I will be able to create a proper image.

No, she would like not to be remembered by such fragments, but by the true change and lessons she brought in to all of us, the lucky ones that got to meet her.

I choose to tell you what I learned from our Babu. Surpingsily it can be described in a quite materialistic assortment of objects: books, science magazines, a magnifiying glass, a tree and a handgun.

What then, did I learn from my grandmother?

Books that will never burn.

My first book was The Little Prince, yet I was way too young to really comprehend what I was being exposed to. Such event deserves a correction. No, my true first book was Fahrenheit 450. And as you may guess, it was my grandmother who gave it to me as a gift. Certainly not the first book, but the most relevant up to date. The details of the event are blurry, a birthday? just a nice present? The more I try to remember, the more I comprehend the abysm of memory.

The book opened my mind to a deep filosofical writer, who was brave enough to dare to dream of the future. Even if the dream was going to be grim. Bradbury masterfully crafts a story that pose both as chilling warning and as ode to melancholy.

Its one of the characters of Bradbury that my Babu reminds me of. In spirit of not spoiling the whole book I will just mention the presence of certain old characters in the book. Who meticously learned all the books that were written, recited every worthy word, phrase and parragraph. Memorizing from beginning to end.

It was these old gang that held the entire human literary production. Fighting back the wave of illiteracy that menaced society. In those heads were the whole of our art, our stories and ultimately our soul.

From that day on ahead, my babu was one of those old wise people. A small lady, with the universe of books in her head. Holding in those sharp thoughts that wove the spirit of our family.

A science magazine that predict the future

Muy Interesante, Very Interesting. Highlighted in big red letters, fronting an image that could well pass in a sci fi movie theather. A spanish science magazine that my family will kindly remember.

This magazine hid no punches. It dared to remind their readers that the future will be bright, that getting to mars is already at the turn of the corner and virtual reality was but certain. (in retrospective, we do need such wild dreaming, they got some right)

It may not be an academic journal, but for me, as isolated teen thirsting for knowledge, it was the jackpot. The gold mine of science.
I loved traveling to Cochabamba, and spent days reading magazine after magazine (even when I could not read, the images were nice and told a story themselves)

It was such a tradition, that even when Babu could not read anymore, she still bought the magazine. Happy to provide knowledge for an army of voracous readers. That was her, always willing to keep her wits sharp, never getting outdated. Oh babu, you would have loved the endless encyclopedias we have access to now.

I truly thank you, for opening my mind to the world of science.

A magnifiying glass and the value of our eyes.

The story of my babu, as every human story ends and begins with the frailty of the human condition. It is our flaws and how we overcome them that defines our charachter. Sometimes these flaws can be cured, but lady luck doesnt smile to all.

To be less criptic my Babu was slowly but progesivily loosing her sight.
You may love your eyes, as we all do, but you have to try to understand the true pain that it brings to lose your bridge to your art. Babu was a voracous reader and writter. Her eyes were her art instruments. Losing them may have meant more than we imagine.

She never gave up though, and kept on writing cards even if that meant using a huge fonts. Reading until she phisically could not anymore. And when everything else failed, TV was there.

I fondly remeber repairing her magnifiying glass the last days I spent alone with her. She wanted to read some documents that required her attention. I thought at the time, that she was the first woman to see by willpower alone as I could not conjure any other explanation.

And a word of warning, dont think that being literally half blind stopped my grandmother in any form. She was fiercely independent and lived alone almost until the last lap life. She managed to handle herself amid the chaos of La Paz, Santa Cruz and even the USA.

She even still managed to pull sneaky victories in the family card game. An avid player, she always managed to surprise us. And she was the one with limited sight.
The Contra Bola was her move, a game that required going against every standart instincint in the game.

So hopefully you start to undersant more of this lady. Even disabilties such as losing her sight were nothing but obstacules to be overcomed. True strategy needs not sight it seems.

A tree that keeps on growing.

Pictures, our entire family history can be told with pictures.From smiles to tears. Diners, graduation, weddings and even funerals. How we humans like to fight against oblivion.

She had this quite neat tree where each branch held a picture from one of us. From seconds distant cousins to the story of the younger brother.
Babu had a code for each contemporary family member. She saw not trees with pictures, but an enourmous branches of family members. Catalogued in neat numbers code. I still try to remember mine, 9 – 3 – 4 the ninth grandson, of the third daughter, but the fourth son. ( I may need to update this)

## Digression, debate, discussion
*Published: November 17, 2020*

Under Hegel wing I find my world

Yet my world doest not reckon me

Of far away wisedom

Of escaping conclusions

Of words left unspoken

A question is flown to the man,

But can the man ask himself such question?

Tradition dictates that words are our bridge

May the alphabet join our infinities

Bitter truth pill we soon all take

Words will never be enough to truly explain

Diggresion, debate, discussion

From chaos, order

From order, creation

My world does not reckon me no more
But do I even find it anymore?

From ideas, reflexion

From realities, uncertainity

Let love be the bundle that hold all together

Let the mistery fill the jar of need

May Art heal your wounds

May your world find you again

Digression, debate, discussion.

## Writing Portfolio

### Academic / Creative
*Making complex ideas fit in elegant words*

**Project Background**
I was part of the student group's marketing / PR team, creating an online exercise as a final project. The activity was an international event focusing on students with an academic background in politics. The participants had to perform tasks to analyze real-life scenarios during a couple of days, but each group had a different set of analytical tools.  
The goal was to compare the results brought upon by the different techniques.

The concept had theories, logistics and solid literature, but it lacked both face and a voice. That is… until I joined Marketing & PR.

**Creative process**
My responsibility was the writing of the website, blog and collaborating with the social media campaign. I also designed and created the logo as well as the graphical language of the group communication.

The challenge here was grabbing interest while being informative. Maintaining a fragile balance between creativity, innovation, and the expected tone of academic circles was no less daunting.

**Final result**
This text was published as a blog entry, explaining the meaning of the group's logo. This piece showcases the versatility of creative writing. Storytelling allows you to easily frame complex ideas and concepts in a more relatable way.

The philosophical aftertaste goes well with academic writing; the desire for answers pervades every academic field.

### Business / Marketing
*The art of how to sell an idea over a few words*

**Project background**
Guacamole is a Mexican restaurant where the food feeds not only the body but also the soul. So when the owner asked me to lend them a hand with the text for the new website, I felt honoured. I knew it was my time to shine.

**Creative process**
The website required crafted texts that spoke directly to the potential client. Every phrase leads to new relevant information about the experience.

My challenge here was innovating while maintaining the desired tone of the original concept.

**Final results**
Storytelling shows up again; I can quickly take the reader to learn about the restaurant's highlights by creating different scenarios. The text concisely portrays the confidence and friendliness of the business.

### Academic / Analytical
*How knowledge is created and transferred*

**Project background**
Term Papers are the bane of those who struggle with putting ideas into paper. But even among the seasoned, the task of stitching together a piece that creates objective knowledge can be quite the vexing.

For my first written paper, I chose a personal topic. My country had almost fallen into a civil war over political disputes. Both sides were hurting and counting deaths. I felt the call to do something about it.

I chose the academic lens to understand this problem by asking if the events during the debacle could be considered a coup d'etat.

**Creative process**
Academic requirements aside, the main challenge here was to create a piece that respected both conflicting sides.

Politics are my passion, so spending hours reading laws and old articles sounded like a perfect date.

**Final results**
Keeping a neutral tone is not only measuring words but also taking into account how ideas are presented.

In these texts, I focused on giving a unique voice to verifiable, factual events. For the unverifiable yet relevant, a distinct tone was used. The idea is that the reader can clearly differentiate facts from opinions.

### Creative / Essay
*Just me letting the words create freely*

My [blog](https://theundercoverlatino.wordpress.com/) host most of my pieces

I put some extracts of some of my essays. So far I have written about politics, sexuality and death. Here I have no concise goal, more than creating beauty for the sake of it.

Empathy, such a word for the artists and the forgotten.
Blinded by the arrogance mankind believed that only they held the universe in their souls.
Some even wondered that only their complexity listened to the mighty Cube.
To treat the rest that is not me with disrespect.
That breakdown spell the downfall of mighty colossi. Disconnection from life is punished by the inherent rules of the cycle.
Such acts of extreme isolation defy the delicate dance of the cosmos.
To define uniqueness and balance chaos
Yet to flow with the rest so you can connect.
No one said the dance was easy.
Empathy is foundational principle next to the creation imperative.
For how can life create in a vacuum? Isolated cells build no organism, lost individuals do not spawn empires.
Empathy becomes then not a choice but a fundamental recognition.
Dust touches us both
We all come from the same source,
Entropy awaits for you as well.
The only difference between you and me are the comically random circumstances of the cycle.
To love me is to love you.
To love anyone is to love the Cube.

Poesía de mi padre:

Tu luz…

Por Raúl Arce Barreda (Chicho)

Tu luz desnuda mi mirada

que borra los silencios a pedazos,

mi alma se refugia

en el color de los cielos

tan sólo pido una estrella

porque sólo soy soledad

Tu luz imprime mi desierta

playa de amores,

mi ser contempla la joven amante

una ave fugitiva

es mi estrella

donde sus cristales

movibles de sus ojos negros

arrullan mi inviolable exilio

por días

por meses

por años

por una vida

porque sólo soy ocaso

Tu luz cae

sobre las flores heladas

mis horas caen hechas de cenizas

y el rio de mi alma busca tan sólo

el perfume de tu sombra fugitiva;

es noche

cae nieve

tu luz

mi estrella al pie de mi ventana

porque sólo soy silencio.

And a version for myself, If if may dare the arrogance

to use the words and art of my father.

ironic isnt it? What am I, but an amalgation of both of them?

Your light

Your light bare my gaze

that steals the silences piece by piece

my soul shelters

in the colour of the skies

I ask but for a star

because I am solitude

Your light imprints my deserted

beach of loves

my being contemplates the young lover

a fugitive bird

is my star

where her moving crystals

of her black eyes

lulls my inviolable exile

for days

for months

for years

for one life

because I am twilight

Your light fells

over the frozen flowers

my hours fell turning into ashes

and the river of my soul seeks only

the perfume of your fugitive soul

it is night

snow falls

your light

the star at the foot of my window,

because I am only silence.

Und jetzt, noch eine Zumutung, Gedicht meines Vaters, diesmal auf der Sprache des Abendslands

Dein Licht

Dein licht entkleidet mein Blick

der meine Stille stuckweise klaut,

meine Seele sucht Zuflucht

in die Farben der Himmel

ich frage nur nach eine Sterne

weil ich Einsamkeit bin.

Dein Licht druck meine einsamer Strand der Liebe aus

mein Selbst blickt die junge Geliebte ein,

eine flüchtige Vögel

ist mein Stern

wo die bewegliche Kristallen ihre Augen

mein unantastbare Exil einlullen

tagelang

monatelang

jahrelang

lebenslang

da ich nur Dämmerung bin.

Dein licht fällt

auf gefrorene Blume

meine Stunden zerfallen zu Asche

und die Flusse meiner Seele such lediglich

das Perfüm deinen flüchtigen Schatten,

nun ist Abends

Schnee fällt

dein Licht

meine Sterne unten an meinem Fenster

da ich nur Stille bin…
